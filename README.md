# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository is for my submission to the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
I'm using this project to practice building a linear regression model and to learn how to use the scikit-learn library.
