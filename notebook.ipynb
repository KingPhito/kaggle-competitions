    "This notebook is a solution to the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the final price of each home given a set of features. The metric used to evaluate the model is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.\n",
